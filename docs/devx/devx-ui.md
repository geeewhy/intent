# Developer Companion UI (DevX UI)

The Intent DevX UI is a web-based side panel that lets you interact with the running Intent system in real time. It serves as a companion tool for developers, providing a visual interface to work with the event-sourced system during development and debugging.

## Current Features

The DevX UI offers several powerful features to enhance the developer experience:

* **Command issuer** – A form-driven interface to create and dispatch commands, with schema validation. This allows you to interact with the system without writing code.

* **Event stream viewer** – Live tail of events as they occur, with filters. Watch events flow through the system in real time as you issue commands.

* **Trace viewer** – Visualization of correlated spans/traces to follow a command through to completion. See how a command propagates through the system, from initial handling to event generation and projection updates.

* **Projections explorer** – View the state of read models and detect schema drift or issues. Inspect the current state of your projections and ensure they're in sync with your code.

* **AI assistant (experimental)** – Scaffolding for commands/sagas and Q&A with context. Get help generating new commands or understanding the system.

* **Multi-tenant/role switching** – Simulate different user perspectives by switching between tenants and roles. Test how your system behaves for different users.

## Running the DevX UI Locally

To run the DevX UI locally, follow these steps:

1. Run the admin API
```bash
   npm run api:admin
```

2. Navigate to the DevX UI directory in another terminal:
   ```bash
   cd devex-ui/
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the given local URL in your browser.

## Configuration Options

By default, the DevX UI runs in mock mode with fake data, which is useful for quick experimentation without a running backend. To connect to a real Intent instance:

1. Set the API mode to 'real' in your environment:
   ```
   VITE_API_MODE='real'
   ```

2. Point to your running backend API:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL='http://localhost:3000'
   ```

You can set these variables in a `.env.local` file in the `devex-ui/` directory or pass them when starting the development server:

```bash
VITE_API_MODE='real' VITE_API_URL='http://localhost:3000' npm run dev
```

## Architecture and Safety

The DevX UI is designed to be both powerful and safe:

- It uses the same backend ports and respects access control, so using the UI is like using the real system, not bypassing it.
- It's "local-first", making it useful both for quick experimentation and real debugging.
- The UI is completely separate from the core system, so it can't compromise the integrity of your production environment.

## When to Use the DevX UI

The DevX UI is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **During development**: Quickly fire commands instead of writing manual scripts to test your features.
- **Debugging**: Watch how events flow when testing a new feature and identify issues in the event chain.
- **Learning the system**: Explore the command and event structure to understand how the system works.
- **Demonstrating functionality**: Show stakeholders how the system behaves without writing code.
- **Testing multi-tenant scenarios**: Switch between tenants to verify proper isolation and behavior.

## Getting Started

After launching the DevX UI, you'll see a dashboard with different panels for each feature. Here's a quick guide to get started:

1. Use the **Command Issuer** panel to create and send a test command
2. Watch the **Event Stream** panel to see the events generated by your command
3. Check the **Trace Viewer** to see how your command was processed
4. Explore the **Projections** panel to see how the read models were updated

This workflow gives you a complete view of how commands flow through the system, from initial dispatch to final state changes.
